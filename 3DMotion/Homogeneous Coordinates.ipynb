    "So why should we talk about Homogeneous coordinates? Homogeneous coordinates are used to explain projective geometry. This coordinate system has the advantage of being able to represent points at infinity using finite coordinates. With this, we can say that our camera is a box with an *infinitesimally* small hole that captures light from the outside world. This also means that the center of the hole, **camera center**, is the intersection of all of the rays of light captured by the camera. Let's say the back of our box that captures the projection is the **image plane** and that the distance between the **camera center** and the **image plane** is the **camera constant**."
