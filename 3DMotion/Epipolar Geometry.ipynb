    "Both parameterizations of dependent images are general and can represent all geometric configurations. The photogrammetric parameterization of dependent images has a singularity when the base vector, $B_{X}$, is orthogonal to the $X$ axis. In this case, the base components $B_{Y}$ and $B_{Z}$ are infinitely large, leading to instability."
